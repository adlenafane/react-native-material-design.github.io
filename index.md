title: React Native Material Design
---

Welcome to React Native Material Design, an open source project which aims to bring Material Design to Android through [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) by Facebook. The library is made up of many components, which can be found in the sidebar. If a component is not listed, this is either because it has not yet been developed, is available as a default `react-native` component (such as the Switch) or it simply cannot be created due to the limitations of React Native (such as a Dialog).

We welcome all pull requests, suggestions, ideas or any constructive feedback! Please visit the [repository](https://github.com/react-native-material-design/react-native-material-design) to get involved.

> These components have only been tested on Android and not iOS. However, you're welcome to have a go if you're into that sort of cross-breeding development.
